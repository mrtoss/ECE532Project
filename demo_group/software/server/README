This is the code for demo server

To use them:
    make a echoserver template project like tutorial 5
    replace the main.c and echo.c with the code in this folder

The code is default for workstation 10, to modify that, changed the lines of main.c
line 130: change the last byte to 0xXX where XX is the workstation number
line 157: change to IP4_ADDR(&ipaddr,  1, 1,   XX, 2); where XX is the workstation number
